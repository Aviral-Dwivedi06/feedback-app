# Feedback App

This project is a minimal full-stack web application designed to collect and display user feedback.

## Features

- Users can submit their name and feedback through a form.
- Submitted feedback is displayed below the form, with the latest feedback shown first.
- Feedback entries include timestamps.
- Form validation ensures the name and message fields are not empty.
- Data is stored persistently using a JSON file on the backend.
- Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.
- Deployed via GitHub Pages and/or Render (for backend).
